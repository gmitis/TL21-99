## Backend tests
<!-- backend_tests -->
Functional testing scripts for backend which consist a postman collection. Run this collection in postman to do the testing. 
For each endpoint [passesupdate, healthcheck, resetpasses, resetstations, resetvehicles] we test if:
* Status code is 200
* Response time is less than X ms
